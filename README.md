# Rust Web Example
Programmer: Devon Bedenbaugh, beden2@pdx.edu
Homework repository for CS410 rust web development. Assignments will be stored here for grading purposes.  

Most folders are just for learning purposes and some don't even run properly.
The final_project folder contains my most up to date CRUD api. It's memory persists
past program termination and i stored in a postgres server. A proper custom error handler
is currently being implemented and the next step is a more proper frontend.
